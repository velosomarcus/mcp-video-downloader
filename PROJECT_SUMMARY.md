## 🚀 Quick Setup

### For Claude Desktop Users:

1. **Build Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t mcp-video-downloader .
   ```

2. **Update Claude Configuration:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "video-downloader": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp-video-downloader"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Ask Claude:**

   > "Download this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=example"

4. **Receive Your Video:**
   - Video is automatically transferred to your Claude Desktop session
   - Files are streamed directly, no manual file retrieval needed

## ✨ Key Innovations

### � **Streaming File Transfer**

```python
def encode_file_as_base64(file_path):
    """Converts downloaded file to base64 for MCP transfer"""
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        content = f.read()
        encoded = base64.b64encode(content).decode('utf-8')
    return encoded
```

### � **Temporary File Management**

```python
def download_and_stream(url, options):
    """Downloads video and streams it via MCP protocol"""
    temp_file = download_video(url, options)
    try:
        encoded_content = encode_file_as_base64(temp_file)
        return {
            "content": encoded_content,
            "filename": os.path.basename(temp_file),
            "size": os.path.getsize(temp_file)
        }
    finally:
        os.remove(temp_file)  # Clean up temporary file
```

### 📊 **Enhanced Response Format**

Every download now returns:

- ✅ **Success status** and error handling
- � **Base64 content**: Encoded file data for direct transfer
- 📁 **File metadata**: Name, size, format, duration
- 🧹 **Clean operation**: No persistent files or storage requirements
- 📈 **Progress log**: Download progress messages

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

The MCP Video Downloader uses a **streaming-based architecture** that eliminates the need for persistent storage or volume mounting:

1. **📥 Download Phase**: Videos are temporarily downloaded using yt-dlp
2. **📤 Encoding Phase**: Files are converted to base64 encoding
3. **🔄 Transfer Phase**: Encoded content is streamed via MCP protocol
4. **🧹 Cleanup Phase**: Temporary files are automatically removed

This approach provides a clean, lightweight solution that works seamlessly with any MCP client without requiring special configuration.
